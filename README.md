# Ashley_Praticed_Java

Hello!
I am a software engineering student, and I am now being intentional about building real coding skills.
This repository contains my Java projects and practice exercises (you can visit my other repository for JavaScript).
I will be practicing topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithms.
These will start as small projects, but over time, they will grow and improve as I do.
